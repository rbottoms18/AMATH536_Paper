This assignment was completed as a cumulative final assignment for AMATH 536 Mathematical Modeling of Cancer with Prof. Mamis
at the University of Washington, Spring 2024. The writeup of the assignment can be read in report.pdf.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.m contains functions for modeling the tumor models and radiaiton doses, as well as plotting the results found in report.pdf.
sde_1.m, sde_2.m, and sde_3.m contain three attempts at modeling stochastic differential equations for the model.
model_fp.np contains Mathematica code for computing fixed point and stabilities of fixed points for both the general and simplified models.
stochastic_matrix.np contains Mathematica code for computing the matrix used in the formulation of the SDEs.
