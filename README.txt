This repository contains code for the quarter paper for AMATH 536 Mathematical Modeling of Cancer taken with Konstantinos Mamis.

main.m contains functions for modeling the tumor models and radiaiton doses, as well as plotting the results found in report.pdf.
sde_1.m, sde_2.m, and sde_3.m contain three attempts at modeling stochastic differential equations for the model.
model_fp.np contains Mathematica code for computing fixed point and stabilities of fixed points for both the general and simplified models.
stochastic_matrix.np contains Mathematica code for computing the matrix used in the formulation of the SDEs.
